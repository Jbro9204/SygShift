# SygShift Future Items

This is the active queue for approved or retained work that has not been completed.

Keep this repository copy synchronized with:
`C:\Users\Jordan\Desktop\SygShift Future Items\FUTURE_ITEMS.md`

## Queue Rules

- Every item must have a category, priority, target window, status, and added date.
- Assign work to the category that owns the outcome, even when implementation touches several areas.
- When an item is completed, record it in the dated changelog and `DEVLOG.md`, then remove it from this active queue.
- Do not mark an item complete because a screen or button exists. The full authorized workflow, persistence, audit behavior, tests, and production verification must be complete.
- All displayed dates and dated documentation use MM/DD/YYYY.

## Time, Attendance & Payroll

### Dedicated Payroll Workspace and Export Navigation

- Priority: High
- Target window: Near-term payroll experience release
- Status: Approved / queued
- Added: 08/25/2026

Separate payroll work from the general Time & Attendance workspace and remove the need to scroll through a long employee list before reaching export controls.

Required outcomes:

- Give Payroll Export a dedicated, permission-controlled navigation destination.
- Keep Time & Attendance focused on clock status, employee time review, exceptions, and corrections.
- Replace the long always-expanded employee section with a compact searchable summary and open-on-demand employee detail.
- Default payroll views to the current pay period while retaining approved period shortcuts and custom-range export.
- Preserve one summary row per employee, Week 1/Week 2 payroll separation, employee detail sheets, overnight attribution, exception readiness, and official-export locking.

## Workforce Organization & Scheduling

### Supervisor Assignment and Scoped Workforce Visibility

- Priority: Medium
- Target window: After current access and payroll usability work
- Status: Pinned for later
- Added: Before 08/25/2026

Add an Assigned Supervisor field to employee profiles so supervisors can default to the employees they are responsible for without changing the permissions that authorize each action.

Required outcomes:

- Keep permission authorization separate from employee visibility scope.
- Preserve full-company visibility for authorized Admin users.
- Define whether assignments can be employee-based, site/post-based, or both.
- Provide focused views for My Employees, All Employees, Unassigned, and By Supervisor where authorized.
- Preserve audited exception access when a supervisor needs to help outside their normal scope.

## Recruiting & External Integrations

### Indeed Employer Integration and Recruiting Depot

- Priority: Research
- Target window: Later expansion
- Status: Pinned for later
- Added: Before 08/25/2026

Research whether Indeed Employer can connect to SygShift/Sygilant and support a dedicated Recruiting Depot for applicants, recruiting stages, licensing progress, and onboarding handoff.

Required outcomes:

- Confirm available Indeed Employer APIs, permissions, costs, and data-use limitations before committing to an integration.
- Define the recruiting record lifecycle and its handoff into the employee, licensing, and user-account workflows.
- Evaluate secure email parsing, controlled CSV intake, or manual intake if a direct integration is not viable.
- Keep the recruiting expansion separate from current production-critical scheduling and payroll work.

## Completed Work

Completed initiatives do not remain in this active queue. Their implementation history is retained in `docs/changelogs/` and `DEVLOG.md`.
